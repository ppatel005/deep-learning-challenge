Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras for Alphabet Soup that can predict whether an organization will be successful based on the provided features in the dataset. The task involves binary classification, where the model is trained to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful organizations funded by Alphabet Soup.


Target Variable:

The target variable for the model was whether or not the funding was successful or not.


Features:

The features used in the model include income amount, the goverment classification, the use for the funding, the affiliation, and how much the company asked for.


The Model:

The target model performace was not good and the accuracy was off. I got a 7.09 accuracy 


Steps to increase model performance:

Changed binning for income amount and changed the number of epochs by increasing it. 

Summary

In summary, the deep learning model exhibited potential but I did not have a great model and stuggled to get proper data. A recommendation for addressing this classification problem is to explore more complex architectures, considering the possibility of overfitting. Additionally, fine-tuning hyperparameters and conducting a more exhaustive search for optimal configurations may lead to improved model performance
